## purpose

For my understanding, I will write some sample codes & upload them.

I try learning Machine Learning Algorithms below.

- Generic Algorithm
- Evolutionary Computation
- Regression Algorithms
- Instance-based Algorithms
- Regularization Algorithms
- Decision Tree Algorithms
- Bayesian Algorithms
- Clusteing Algorithms
- Association Rule Learning Algorithms
- Artificial Neural Network Algorithms
- Deep Learning Algorithms
- Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms
- Ensemble Algorithms
- and more..

I don't know well yet.
